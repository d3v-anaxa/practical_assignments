01. WAP to print the sum and product of digits of an integer.
02. WAP to reverse a number.
03. WAP to compute the sum of the first n terms of the following series -> S = 1+1/2+1/3+1/4+...
04. WAP to compute the sum of the first n terms of the following series -> S =1-2+3-4+5...
05. Write a function that checks whether a given string is Palindrome or not. Use this function to find whether the string entered by user is Palindrome or not.
06. Write a function to find whether a given no. is prime or not. Use the same to generate the prime numbers less than 100.
07. WAP to compute the factors of a given number.
08. WAP to print a triangle of stars as follows (take number of lines from user):

```cpp
       *
     * * *
   * * * * * 
 * * * * * * *
```

23. Create a class Triangle. Include overloaded functions for calculating area. Overload
assignment operator and equality operator.

25. Create a structure Student containing fields for Roll No., Name, Class, Year and Total
Marks. Create 10 students and store them in a file.

26. Write a program to retrieve the student information from file created in previous question and
print it in following format:
Roll No.
Name Marks

27. Copy the contents of one text file to another file, after removing all whitespaces.

28. Write a function that reverses the elements of an array in place. The function must
accept only one pointer value and return void.

29. Write a program that will read 10 integers from user and store them in an array. Implement
array using pointers. The program will print the array elements in ascending and descending
order.
